# Personal Research Paper Log

## Method

Each paper after reading will have a short summary and highlights from the paper that can be used as a quick reference and guide to what the paper details. Each paper must be givin a topic or statement of perceived bias as a means to show the document is ingested with the context that all research is inherently done with biases due to investment, workplace, location/institute that the research was conducted, etc. This is not in a means to dilute the efforts of the research or findings, but to train myself to seek out reasons that the paper and results may be shown in the way they are. 

## Sections

Once there is enough papers in the catalog, I will update this with the sections of research such as Memory, Branch Prediction, Pipelining, etc. Currently there is one for 3D-memory, register allocation, and overall architecture progress.
